# famAI Login Instructions

## ✅ Login is Now Working!

The MongoDB integration is complete and login functionality is fully implemented.

## 🔑 How to Login

### Option 1: Use the Default Admin Account
- **Email**: `admin@famai.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### Option 2: Register a New Account
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/register.html
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Use your new credentials to login

## 🚨 Important: Use the Correct Login Form

**DO NOT click on the social login buttons** (Google, GitHub, Autodesk) - these are placeholders and will show "will be implemented soon" messages.

**USE THE EMAIL/PASSWORD FORM** at the top of the page:
1. Enter your email address
2. Enter your password  
3. Click the "Sign In" button

## 🎯 After Login

Once logged in, you'll be redirected to:
- **Main Interface**: `/famai` - Create families with AI
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard` - View your created families

## 🏠 Dashboard Features

The dashboard shows:
- **Your Created Families**: All families you've created
- **Filter Options**: By category and status
- **Statistics**: Total families, downloads, etc.
- **Family Management**: View details, download, delete

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing "Login functionality will be implemented soon":

1. **Make sure you're using the email/password form** (not the social login buttons)
2. **Check your credentials** - use the admin account or register a new one
3. **Clear your browser cache** and try again
4. **Check the browser console** for any JavaScript errors

## 🎉 Success!

Once logged in, you can:
- ✅ Create families using natural language
- ✅ View your personal family library
- ✅ Download RFA files
- ✅ Track your usage statistics
- ✅ Manage your account and preferences

The system now provides complete user management with persistent storage of all your created families!
